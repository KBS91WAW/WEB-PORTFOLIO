            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In my role within the international ROCKSAFE project, I was tasked with development of software for interfacing with various biological and chemical sensors. My responsibilities extended to the integration of multiple communication protocols, including Modbus, IrDA, SPI, and RS232, into a singular data frame. This frame was then transmitted via radio to a central station. At this station, the data I transmitted was combined with imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles and other visual threat detection systems, a collaborative effort developed by teams from Ireland and Spain. The culmination of this project was its successful deployment during an official demonstration at an Irish military base near Dublin, an event at which I was personally present.</p>
            
            <h2>Project Scope</h2>
            <p>The ROCKSAFE project involved creating sophisticated software solutions for integrating multiple sensor types to provide real-time monitoring, data collection, and safety management in industrial and mining applications.</p>
